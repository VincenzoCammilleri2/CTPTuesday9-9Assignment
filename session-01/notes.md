compiled vs interpreted languages

## ECMA Script

- ES5
- ES6 / ES2015

## Backend work

Use Node.js. It allows JavaScript to function like C++ and Python. It has full access to hardware and computer resources.

## Frontend work

In the browser, we're using JavaScript syntax, but can't access the local computer resources. It can only manipulate the HTML and CSS and use Web Browser API's.

## Searching Google for help

- use `mdn` as a keyword to search the mozilla docs
- _i.e._ Google search `mdn array add element`
